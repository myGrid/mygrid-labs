		RCPForms is a very thin layer on top of standard eclipse APIs
focused on offering an easy to learn API which is based a lot
on defaults (80% case should not need any configuration parameters)
and best practices (e.g. for list-based controls you would like
to use a viewer instead of programming directly against the SWT
control).

The Presentation Model approach separates UI from Data. UI code
mainly consists of creating controls, layout and binding against
data and ui state attributes in the presentation model.

* Java Beans and EMF to be used as presentation model, all model
dependencies factored out into a model adapter
* Wrappers around SWT Widgets to enhance with state/decoration
rendering
* Eclipse Data binding also used for UI state binding
* support for automatic handling of enumerations, arbitrary enumeration
datatypes can be used via adapter, e.g. extensible Enumerations
where Literals might be loaded from a Database. Default support
for java enums included.
* Table Configuration for easy creation of editable tables and
binding against Lists of beans.
* Validation of field values with error markers using Eclipse
Databinding
* Validator concept where validators declare their field dependencies
and validation state is managed by the framework
* RCP Forms are designed in a way that the same form class can
be used in all contexts with same behavior
* Forms can be composed of FormParts, which are reusable in other
locations
