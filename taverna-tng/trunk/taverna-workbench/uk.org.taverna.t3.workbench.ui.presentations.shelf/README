This is Eclipse UI Presentation is heavily based on the "Nebula PShelf-based Presentation" available here:
http://www.eclipse.org/nebula/widgets/presentation_shelf/presentation_shelf.php

Original source code is in the CVS. Browsable source link:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.swt.nebula/org.eclipse.swt.nebula.presentations.shelf/?root=Technology_Project

We have taken the code, updated it to use the latest PShelf and PGroup libs and modified it to suit our needs.
